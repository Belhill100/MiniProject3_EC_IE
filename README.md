## Project Description
This project focuses on creating an algorithmic music composition for a video game using **OpenMusic (OM)**. The objective is to generate a 2-minute piece of music using programming techniques such as random numbers, loops, conditionals, and data structures available in OM. No pre-existing audio material (WAV, MIDI, MP3, etc.) is allowed. The music must align with the chosen video game's theme and atmosphere, providing an immersive experience.

### Key Constraints
- **Tool**: OpenMusic (OM) must be used for music generation.
- **No Pre-stored Material**: No pre-existing music files such as WAV, MIDI, or MP3 may be used.
- **Game Consistency**: The piece must match the style and mood of the chosen video game.
- **Duration**: The music must be at least 2 minutes long.
- **Fresh Content**: A minimum of 1 minute of the music must be original and non-repetitive.
- **Typed Programming**: All arguments and variables in the code must have defined types (e.g., function parameters and return types).
- **Video Submission**: A video showing gameplay along with the composed music must be uploaded to YouTube.

### Why OpenMusic (OM)?
We chose OM for its powerful algorithmic composition capabilities, allowing us to programmatically define and manipulate musical structures. This tool enables us to meet the project constraints while giving us creative flexibility to shape the music in a way that complements the game dynamics.

## Justification
The music composition algorithm was carefully designed to create a balanced and engaging soundtrack that evolves alongside the gameplay. By using random numbers, we were able to introduce variability in the rhythm and melody, ensuring freshness throughout the composition. Additionally, loops were employed to control transitions between musical sections, aligning with the game’s pacing and atmosphere.

The piece adheres to the project’s requirement of having at least 1 minute of unique music by using generative techniques that prevent exact repetitions while maintaining thematic coherence. The use of typed programming in our functions ensures clarity and consistency in the algorithm's logic.
